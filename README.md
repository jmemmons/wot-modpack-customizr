# WoT Modpack Customizr

This program is a simple installer for use with World Of Tanks which aids the user in installing and removing modpacks. It works simply by just having the executable in the same directory as the mods. When the user clicks "Install", the program loops through all of the mods that are selected and copies folders accordingly to the correct direcory where they belong.

### Installation and Usage
* Download a copy of the latest modpack by `theman97` at [MPGH.com][MPGH]. (His modpack should come with the latest copy of the WoT Modpack Customizr)
* Ensure that `WoT Modpack Customizr.exe` is in the same directory as the mods. Example screenshot [here][folder screenshot]. This is all that is required for installation purposes.
* Step 1. Choose the path to the game's directory.
